        My project is a web application built with a **Streamlit frontend** and a **Node.js Express backend** that
        integrates with Spotify's API to showcase personalized user data. The backend handles secure authentication
        with Spotify, fetching user-specific data such as playlists, top tracks, favorite artists, and listening habits.
        This data is processed and served to the Streamlit application, which provides an intuitive and interactive
        interface for users to explore their Spotify statistics. The platform combines the simplicity of Streamlitâ€™s
        Python-based UI design with the scalability and efficiency of a Node.js backend, delivering a seamless and
        visually appealing experience.
